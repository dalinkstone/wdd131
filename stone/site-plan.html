			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/000000-ffffff-808080-c6ac8f"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/000000-ffffff-808080-c6ac8f</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[black]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[white]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[grey]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#c6ac8f]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Judson
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Inter
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
				commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate
				velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint
				occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
				mollit anim id est laborum.
			</p>
			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
			<p class="colored">
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
				commodo consequat.
			</p>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Contact Us</a>
				<a href="#"></a>
			</nav>
			<hr />

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>The home page will display the logo, a brief blurb to draw the eye with a description about what we do and how we can deliver value. The nav bar is going to be vertically displayed on the right side of the screen with only a 'Home' link and a 'Contact Us' link.</p>
			<h3>Contact Us</h3>
			<p>The contact us form will have boxes for Name, Return Email, and then a body message. All of the fields will be required and the body message will require at least 100 characters. I would also want to setup captcha too if possible, but I don't want to commit to this because I haven't done any research on how to do it.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The home page should scroll into the Contact Us page ideally. So there is no real pagination, just as you scroll you get to the "Contact Us Page". If this technically does not meet the requirements, then we'll scrape it and just do a linking child page.
			</p>
				<img src="images/wireframe-1.png" alt="this is a wireframe for the landing page">

			<h3>Contact Us</h3>
			<p>
				The child page should only be the form box with email capability and perhaps captcha, but I don't want to commit to enabling captcha, because I'm not sure if I can even do it.
